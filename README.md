# ErdGenerator
Entity Relationship Diagram Generator


There are barely foreign keys in some Legacy Systems even though foreign keys are quite important to analyze data structure.


But we know there are logical relationships in the queries like join.


So this project generate an erd diagram from queries. It analyzes queries to get the tables and the relationships.


Then, select some data from the tables to figure out how they related like 1:1, 1:N, N:N.


By using that information, it will draw the erd diagram.
